# Discora

Discora (Distributed Conflict Resolution Architecture) is an experimental implementation of the conflict resolution portion of the UAS Traffic Management project. While this work uses ideas developed in the paper titled "Short-Term Conflict Avoidance for Unmanned Aircraft Traffic Management" by Hao Yi Ong and Mykel J. Kochenderfer (see [our paper](http://web.stanford.edu/~haoyi/projects/short-term-conf-reso.pdf)), the focus here is to create an efficient system to handle a large volume of conflict resolution requests in a distributed streaming setting.
